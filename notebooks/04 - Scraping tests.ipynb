      "Since the first confirmed case of reinfection, reported in Hong Kong on Aug. 24, there have been three published cases; reports of another 20 await scientific review. It’s impossible to know exactly how widespread the phenomenon is.\n",
      "A vast majority of people who do get reinfected may go undetected. The man in Hong Kong had no symptoms the second time, and his infection was discovered only because of routine screening at the airport.\n",
      "“If this was a very common event, we would have seen thousands of cases,” Dr. Iwasaki said. Reinfections can occur for any number of reasons.\n",
      "In other reinfected patients, genetic factors or the lack of certain previous immune exposures may have blunted the body’s ability to fight off a second attack. In a vast majority of known infected patients, experts said, the immune system functions as it should against other pathogens.\n",
      "For every confirmed case of reinfection, there are dozens of anecdotal reports of infected people who were sick and seemingly recovered. Usually there are crucial data missing in those cases, like a confirmed lab diagnosis.\n",
      "The virus may set off an inflammatory response that can flare up even weeks later. In rare cases, some patients may develop a chronic low-grade infection with the virus.\n",
      "South Korean researchers investigated hundreds of reports of reinfection and were able to rule them out as real cases. Similar procedures would be needed to rule out the possibility of transmission in each patient.\n",
      "The worry is that the immunity produced by vaccines will not be sufficient in preventing reinfections with the virus. In reality, vaccines have a better chance at generating robust immunity than does natural infection.\n",
      "Vaccines can also be manipulated to enhance immune memory, in that way producing more lasting, more protective responses. Vaccine trials are designed to look for an absence of disease, not infection.\n"
