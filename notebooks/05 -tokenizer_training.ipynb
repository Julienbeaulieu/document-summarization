Mr. Trump has promoted such treatments, without evidence, as a “cure” for his condition.\\nEli Lilly has applied for authorization of its drug for mild or moderate cases of Covid-19. Company is also trialing its antibody treatment in people who have recently tested positive for the coronavirus.\\nEli Lilly also hopes to collect data to figure out whether antibodies can protect certain people from developing Covid-19 after encountering the virus. Given too late — as, perhaps, could be the case in some severely ill patients who are already in the hospital — antibodies may have little effect.'"
